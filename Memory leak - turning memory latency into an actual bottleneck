<h3>Memory leak, turning memory latency into an actual bottleneck</h3>
This issue, if not addressed properly, can lead to a system failure over time gradually and calmly. Generally, if the fundamental testing is not performed at the beginning of the process, the issue may not be apparent. This can result in a decrease in performance and efficiency indicators, sometimes after developers have made changes and modifications and after the deployment of the system. As a result, it is crucial to implement proper testing procedures and performance monitoring to prevent memory leaks and ensure the system is functioning efficiently and effectively.

  Naturally, without proper profiling, finding and fixing issues can be a difficult task. If the application has complex business logic, guessing and trying to locate the problem can be a time-consuming process. Interestingly, garbage collection is not a panacea for all issues, and the problem must be precisely identified, including the specific system component and the nature of the issue.

  As an example, consider a Java application that acts as a proxy component in a telecommunications system between two other applications, processing any streaming data passing through and adding a series of metadata or payloads to the end of data packets. Assume that all processing is also in-memory and the disk is not involved. In this scenario, with only a minor issue in memory management and failure to manually release resources that the GC is unable to recognize (such as unclosed resources, static fields, and other issues in Java), memory can turn into a bottleneck.
