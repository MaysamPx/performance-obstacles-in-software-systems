Limitations and obstacles that cause slowdowns in software systems

<p> Efficiency is a critical consideration when dealing with resource limitations in software systems. These constraints, which are typically present in most systems, including hardware and software aspects such as disk, processor, and main memory, can restrict the performance of the overall system or a critical subsystem moment by moment or continuously. In the context of software systems, components that impede performance in this way are commonly referred to as bottlenecks.
For instance, a large accounting system may feature a powerful processing core for calculating complex payroll details, taxes, and insurance rules, but its performance may be limited by a relatively simple reporting subsystem that is utilized by users. This may result in low utilization of underlying resources and reduced efficiency of the system. In the following sections, we will discuss several common types of bottlenecks in software systems. </p>

<h3> Transferring existing delays in external service APIs to the system internally </h3>
<p> 
One of the potential bottlenecks that designers face within a system, especially a monolithic one, is the reliance on external APIs to hold and maintain resources (such as threads). The assumption underlying this design is that the external system is always in a stable state and guarantees a response time for every request. However, this assumption can often be violated in practice, and the external system can suffer from delay, downtime, and failure. At that moment, the abstraction that has been created makes it difficult for the current system designer to understand the details of the delay in the external system. Although this abstraction is created for simplicity and to provide a unified picture, it hides the details of the problem by drawing a veil of ambiguity. Therefore, the subsystem or module that is responsible for the primary task of connecting to the external system's APIs (even synchronously) can potentially become a bottleneck.
