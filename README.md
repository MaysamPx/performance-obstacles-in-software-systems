Limitations and obstacles that cause slowdowns in software systems

<p> Efficiency is a critical consideration when dealing with resource limitations in software systems. These constraints, which are typically present in most systems, including hardware and software aspects such as disk, processor, and main memory, can restrict the performance of the overall system or a critical subsystem moment by moment or continuously. In the context of software systems, components that impede performance in this way are commonly referred to as bottlenecks.
For instance, a large accounting system may feature a powerful processing core for calculating complex payroll details, taxes, and insurance rules, but its performance may be limited by a relatively simple reporting subsystem that is utilized by users. This may result in low utilization of underlying resources and reduced efficiency of the system. In the following sections, we will discuss several common types of bottlenecks in software systems. </p>
