<h3> Limitations in key system operations can result in hidden operational bottlenecks </h3>

<p>
Limited functionality of a key operation in a system results in hidden operational bottlenecks. Consider an online shopping system where one of the main operations is registering a new order in the shopping cart and a top-level metric for measuring system efficiency is the "time taken to register an order until electronic payment," regardless of browsing time. Under normal conditions, this operation and others occur with less delay, but during peak periods, such as "sales" or "calendar events like holidays and Black Friday," the system may slow down, causing the number of "cart registrations per unit time" to decrease or the upper limit of the expected number to drop to a lower value. By "slowdown," we mean a significant increase in this time metric and its correlation with the number of orders mentioned.
